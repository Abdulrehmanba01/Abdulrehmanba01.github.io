### ICG Verify Process
#### Description
ICG Verify Process is the process where we validate a pair of information containing both routingNumber that must be of 9-digits and accountNumber that must be of 14 digits for the same bank that is being validated. After the account has been created,  you will need to verify the information by making a **POST /IcgVerify/Process** request
#### POST-JSON

curl -X POST \
  --url 'https://verify.icheckdev.com/IcgVerify/Process' \
  -H 'Authorization: Authorization'\
  -H 'Accept: application/json'\
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw '{
  "bankAccount": {
    "routingNumber": "routingNumber0",
    "accountNumber": "accountNumber4"
  }

### ICG Verify Process Extended
#### Description
This is the extended version of the ICG Verify feature. It only can be used if the merchant provided has the permission _FEATURE_ICG_VERIFY_EXTENDED_  assigned to the related user authenticated. As this extended verification process is for the commercial users i.e., merchants so this will need more verification parameters than the usual user. This feature exploits all the microbilt options to validate the merchant account based on many other parameters besides the Bank Route Number and Account Number.

The responses and response codes on this endpoint are same as the one listed above in the 'ICG Verify Process' section.

# For .NET
  
## Getting Started
  
### Description
For developers and users alike, the iCheckGateway verify API in.NET streamlines the process of integrating other web programmes that might serve as a back office solution. It places a strong focus on processing credit card payments and ACH checks. Your company will become more productive while offering the merchants and the intended audience the efficient and effective services by implementing it into your payment-configured platforms. Customers will be able to pay via eCheck, ACH transfer, or credit/debit card in a more secure method thanks to the integration of these APIs. All the information needed to use the ICG Verify Service and conduct ACH Verification is included in the ICG Verify API endpoints.
  
#### Building
  
This API requires you to install 
  
  ```markdown Newtonsoft Json.NET NuGet ``` 
  
package. If you have enabled the **automatic NuGet package restore** then all the dependencies will get installed automatically. Therefore, you will need internet access for build.

**Steps to Proceed:**
  
1. Open the solution (ICGAPIVerify.sln) file
2. Invoke the build process using 
  
  ```markdown Ctrl + Shift + B ``` 
  
  shortcut key or using the Build menu.
  
3. The build process generates a portable class library, which can be used like a normal class library. The generated library is compatible with 
  
     I) Windows Forms
    II) Windows RT
    III) Windows Phone 8
    IV) Silverlight 5 
     V) Xamarin iOS 
    VI) Xamarin Android and Mono
  
More information on how to use can be found at the **MSDN Portable Class Libraries documentation**.  
  
  
The API uses the following base URL:

> https://verify.icheckdev.com 

#### Authorization 
This API uses the following header parameters for authentication.
|Header       | Default   |Description|
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
|Authorization| None      | API Access token provided by the Auth API after User authentication| 

The request looks like this:
```markdown
curl https://verify.icheckdev.com \
  -H 'Authorization: {AUTHORIZATION}'
 ```
 
 ```markdown
 GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: {HOST}
Authorization: {AUTHORIZATION}
```
